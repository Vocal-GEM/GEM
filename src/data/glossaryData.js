    {
        term: "Abdominal Breathing",
        definition: "Also known as diaphragmatic breathing. The expansion of the abdomen during inhalation, allowing the diaphragm to lower and the lungs to fill efficiently without raising the shoulders."
    },
    {
        term: "Abdominals",
        definition: "The 'core' muscles (transverse abdominis, obliques) that stabilize the body and support breath control during speech. They work in tandem with the diaphragm to manage airflow."
    },
    {
        term: "Abduction",
        definition: "The opening of the vocal folds, which occurs during breathing to allow air to pass into and out of the lungs. The opposite of adduction."
    },
    {
        term: "Acid Reflux (GERD/LPR)",
        definition: "A condition where stomach acid travels up into the esophagus (GERD) or throat (LPR). LPR ('Silent Reflux') is particularly relevant to voice, causing hoarseness and throat clearing without typical heartburn."
    },
    {
        term: "Acoustics",
        definition: "The science of sound properties. In voice training, we manipulate the acoustics of the vocal tract (R1, R2) to change the brightness or darkness of the sound."
    },
    {
        term: "Active Practice",
        definition: "Deliberate, focused training where you are consciously attending to specific technical goals (e.g., resonance, pitch), as opposed to passive or mindless repetition."
    },
    {
        term: "Adduction",
        definition: "The closing of the vocal folds, bringing them together to resist airflow and produce sound (phonation). The opposite of abduction."
    },
    {
        term: "ADHD",
        definition: "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. A neurodevelopmental condition affecting attention and regulation. Voice practice may need to be adapted to suit different focus styles and energy levels."
    },
    {
        term: "Aditus Laryngis",
        definition: "The entrance or opening to the larynx from the pharynx."
    },
    {
        term: "AFAB",
        definition: "Assigned Female At Birth. A term used to describe biological sex assignment, separate from gender identity."
    },
    {
        term: "Agender",
        definition: "An identity describing a person who does not identify with any gender."
    },
    {
        term: "Airflow",
        definition: "The movement of air through the vocal tract. Sound is created when airflow meets the resistance of the vocal folds. Managing airflow (Breath Management) is key to a steady voice."
    },
    {
        term: "Air Pressure",
        definition: "The force of air built up below the vocal folds (Subglottic Pressure). Voice power is a balance of Air Pressure and Airflow."
    },
    {
        term: "Ally",
        definition: "An individual who actively supports and advocates for the rights and dignity of marginalized communities, regardless of their own identity."

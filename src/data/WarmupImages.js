        description: 'The “ng” sound, like in ‘English’, is one of the “nasal” consonant sounds. These sounds help us practice singing through our nasal canal, and also give us great support moving into the following vowel sound. You’ll feel these sounds vibrate right in your “mask”, the bones near the front of the face, behind the nose. You can try shriveling up your nose like you’ve smelled something bad to over-exaggerate the sound at first. Practicing single notes with these sounds, paired with the various open vowel sounds mentioned above (Ah, Eh, Ee, Oh, Ooh), can help us to engage the vocal cords, practice control, pitch and improve tone and resonance. We can then move through scales, triads and other musical passages using the “ng” or “mm” consonant sounds.'
